        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML consists of elements which each have different functions.</li>
          <li>Nested elements are known as child elements, with the element containing child elements known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>Elements contain opening and closing tags.</li>
          <li>It's good to use semantic elements, those whose name describes its function, to make your code easier to read.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can style a webpage using CSS in 3 ways: inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied directly to a single element.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are where you embed an entire style sheet inside the HTML file. Those rules apply to a that specific page.</li>
          <li>External style sheets are used to style a whole website and keep the code separate based on use. It must be linked in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule comprises: a selector, properties and values. The rule can be applied to all elements, or a class of elements.</li>
          <li>The properties and their respective values are known as declarations, together they make up the declaration block.</li>
          <li>Margin is a property that adds space around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding is a property that adds space around the inside of an element. Increasing the padding increases the overall size of the element.</li>
          <li>If you want to apply properties to all elements on the page, use the * selector.</li>
          <li>Where possible, do not repeat yourself (DRY) by using the same bit of code for more than one property. For example, header and footer.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[your text here]": commits the specified change, change the text to describe what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: receive a branch's modifications to the local environment.</li>
          <li>git push origin "[name of branch]": push changes made locally to remote GitHub branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Adds interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>Is compact and flexible.</li>
          <li>Is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
          <li>Declare a variable and give it a value.</li>
          <li>Retrieve the value by calling the variable.</li>
          <li>There are different data types: string, number, Boolean, array, object.</li>
          <li>Variables are needed to allow values to be dynamic.</li>
          <li>Comments in JavaScript are like in CSS. /* Everything in between is a comment.*/ Or use // on one line.</li>
          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produce a result based on 2 values or variables.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression is 'truthy'.</li>
          <li>A common conditional is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality you want to reuse.</li>
          <li>You connect the JavaScript file to the index.html file like with CSS. With JavaScript you add it to the body element after the footer.</li>
          <li>Arrays are variables that consist of a list of values, they can have mixed data types.</li>
          <li>For loops uses a predictable pattern to perform a task on all items in the array, by allowing a single block of code to run over and over.</li>
